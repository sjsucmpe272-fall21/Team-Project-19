## Topic 1 - Chess Opening Recommender 

### Introduction
With the recent quarantine, there has been a massive chess boom as a result of people having more free time and taking to the internet for fun pastimes. We propose a chess opening recommender system that will give anyone who has a keen interest to improve in chess the best openings to use for them at their current skill level.

### Abstract
At the core, we will be analyzing various chess data/databases to understand the best particular openings at each rating range. The system will then collect user input such as their current rating (or skill level) and the pieces desired (white/black) so that the system can recommend the top 3 openings to the user that would statistically be the best for their current rating. As the user improves in rating, they can keep using the system to receive new opening recommendations and keep improving their chess knowledge and skill.

### Approach
First, we will be analyzing various chess data/databases to understand the best particular openings at each rating range. This will involve a lot of data processing and analysis, and could either be a rule-based process or ML based process (undecided at this time). 

Next, the system will then collect user input. The input will include their current rating (or skill level), the pieces desired (white/black), and possibly other fields (such as perhaps how unique the user wants to be with their opening style) to make the recommendations more interesting. The system will then recommend the top 3 openings to the user that would statistically be the best for their current rating.  

Furthermore, with the user understanding the particular openings they should focus on in order to improve, the system can then search up recent professional games of these particular recommended chess openings in which the player won and provide the games to the user for studying and analyzing purposes. 

### Persona
For any chess player, beginners or advanced.

The form that the system will take will perhaps be a web application.
