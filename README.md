## Attendance System using Face Recognition

### Introduction
Instead of going through the tiring process of taking attendance during a class, it would get a lot easier for the schools and professors if the time taken for this activity was reduced by using some automation. By the result of automation, professors would get some more time to complete their respective syllabus. One of the ways automation can be carried out is by performing face recognition whenever students enter the classroom. In this way, time can be saved by automating the process of mechanically taking attendance in the classroom.

### Abstract
Face recognition can be implemented by getting data from a webcam on the entrance of a classroom. This expression can be captured and various machine learning techniques can be applied onto that data in order to recognize a particular student and mark his/her attendance. First of all, data needs to be collected so that a machine learning model can be trained on top of it. This data should consist of images of students in various expressions like anger, happy, sad, excited, fear, etc. to increase the accuracy of the recognition system. 

### Approach
After the data is collected, it would be ready to get trained into a machine learning model. Techniques like k Nearest Neighbour can be used in order to train the machine learning model on the expression data. The k Nearest Neighbor classifier gives diverse exactness of grouping for various mixes of preparing and testing dataset. Another way to implement face recognition is Support Vector Machine technique. The client might give a capacity, like a line, polynomial, or sigmoid bend, to the SVM, which chooses support vectors along the outer layer of this capacity.

### Persona
Different schools, offices, and universities can be considered as the target audience of this project.
